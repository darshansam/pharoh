	<h2> PHAROH
	</h2>
	<h3>With that in mind, the Pharaoh x Suit will get an upgrade from its previous Mythic Level 6 to an Ultimate Level 7. Krafton has refined the design to go for a more blue and white theme. They have also made the overall skin appearance more flamboyant with what seems to be "wings", a bulkier chest plate, and an Emerald gem at the heart of it all.
